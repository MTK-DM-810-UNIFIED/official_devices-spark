# Clean flash:
- Download ROM from the link above
- Reboot to recovery
- Flash the latest firmware for your region
- Flash ROM zip
- Install GApps if needed and Magisk if you want (v23 or newer are recommended)
- Install the ForcedEncryption disabler if you want to keep your Data unencrypted and be accesible from recovery (recovery doesn't mount encrypted Data partition in A12 so far)
- Format data
- Reboot and voila!

# Updating to a newer build (dirty flash):
- Update via OTA Updater, or
- Flash ROM zip in recovery
- Install GApps and/or Magisk if they were installed previously
- Install the ForcedEncryption disabler if you had disabled the encryption before
- Reboot and voila!
